## Aliens Stole My Sunglasses

#### Technologies:
- Typescript
- Phaser JS
- Pyxel Edit

#### Info:
Strange aliens have landed on Earth.
We don't know why they're here.
To human eyes they look like red monoliths for some reason....

You are one of the aliens. You have entered a warehouse and set off the slient ALARM.
You have 3 minutes to steal as many glasses as you can.
Get back to the exit before time runs out! Or you'll be caught.

Since you have no arms you have to carry them on your face.
Which may cause problems...

#### Controls:
- ENTER to Proceed in menus
- WASD to Move
- E or SPACEBAR to Pickup
- E or SPACEBAR to Search Crates

#### Bugs:
- Collision against the crates is wonky
- Crate can sometimes spawn at the exit
